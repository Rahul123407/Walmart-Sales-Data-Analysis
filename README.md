# Walmart Sales Data Analysis – SQL + Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **data analytics case study** on Walmart sales data.  
It combines **Python** (for cleaning & preprocessing) and **SQL** (for business problem solving) to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and profitability.  

The project simulates a real-world analyst role: cleaning raw data, designing pipelines, writing queries for business problems, and presenting insights.

4. **Sales Volume by Payment Method** → Total items sold by each method.  
5. **Category Ratings by City** → Average, min, and max ratings per city.  
6. **Profitability** → Categories ranked by total profit.  
7. **Preferred Payments** → Most common payment method per branch.  
8. **Sales Shifts** → Morning vs Afternoon vs Evening sales patterns.  
9. **Revenue Decline Analysis** → Branches with the largest YoY revenue drop.
